## Description
The current application setup requires users to input photo classes manually, one by one. For users with numerous classes to define, this method is notably time-consuming. An enhancement to improve user experience and efficiency would be the introduction of a feature for bulk uploading photo classes through a CSV file.

## Benefits
- **Efficiency**: Enables the bulk upload of photo classes, drastically cutting down on setup time.
- **User Experience**: Streamlines the process for those migrating from other systems or who have their photo classes already organized in a spreadsheet.
- **Accuracy**: Reduces the chance of manual entry errors.

## Suggested Implementation
- **CSV Format Validation**: Ensure the CSV file adheres to the required format, featuring a single column where each row represents a photo class name.
- **Error Handling**: Offer clear error messages for issues such as incorrect file formats, invalid characters, or duplicate class names.
- **Integration with Existing UI**: Introduce an "Upload CSV" option in the settings or configuration area where users presently add photo classes, ensuring this feature supplements rather than replaces manual entry.
- **Feedback to Users**: Post-upload, provide a summary detailing the number of classes added and any errors detected.

## Technical Considerations
- Ensure the feature is compatible with various CSV file formats, including those with commas, quotes, and line breaks within cells.
- Address security concerns by validating and sanitizing the input to avert injection attacks.
- Conduct thorough testing across different browsers and devices to guarantee a seamless and responsive user experience.
